# Practice Stuff

This repository is intended to provide practice projects for the developers.

### Motivation

It is easy to learn a language but it hard to understand its core features without challenging projects. It is always a big question what projects should I do to practice the language?

In this repository, developers can find various projects and project ideas to practice.
